        <p>Bike insurance, also known as two wheeler insurance policy is an agreement between a bike owner and a bike insurance provider where the insurer covers the cost of damages to the bike, third-party or in some cases even the bike owner. It essentially protects the bike owner financially on occurrence of any unforeseen accident such as accident, theft or natural disaster. What’s observed is that with the increase of bikes and other types of two wheelers on the road, the probability of an accident also increases, click for <a href="https://www.tataaig.com/knowledge-center/two-wheeler-insurance/steps-to-file-two-wheeler-insurance-accident-claim">steps on how to file an accident claim on your two-wheeler</a>  .
